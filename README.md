This is a standalone version of the [Monocle](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX/Monocle) embedded JavaFX platform implementation. It is a complete, unmodified copy of the Monocle source code available in the [OpenJFX](https://openjdk.org/projects/openjfx/) project, compiled against the proper version of JavaFX (as explained [here](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8308345)) and packaged as a standalone jar.

This is intended to be used with [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) in a headless environment as a replacement for https://github.com/TestFX/Monocle which seems abandoned.
